            <h2>About RaceVision&nbsp;AI</h2>
            <p>
                Horse‑racing punters rely on form guides packed with numbers and terse descriptions.  Valuable clues about how a horse travelled – whether it was trapped wide, finished strongly or fought traffic – are lost in translation.  <strong>RaceVision&nbsp;AI</strong> solves this by using computer vision to identify each runner via racing colours and physical markers, track positions throughout the race and automatically assemble highlight reels that show key moments.  The platform dramatically reduces the time it takes professionals to analyse a field and reveals patterns that text alone cannot.  More than 100,000 races are run each year across the major racing jurisdictions, with over US$100 billion wagered worldwide; even small improvements in analysis can deliver outsized returns for serious punters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our go‑to‑market strategy starts with securing video rights and launching a beta product within six months.  We will partner with leading global bookmakers and wagering exchanges—operators such as <em>bet365</em>, Betway, 1xBet, Parimatch, Unibet and William&nbsp;Hill—who collectively serve tens of millions of customers and dominate the racing markets.  Industry observers suggest there may be between <strong>0.5 and 1 million</strong> professional or semi‑professional racing punters worldwide, concentrated in mature markets like the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and Hong Kong.  Their appetite for sophisticated tools is evident: one prominent online tipping service launched in 2010 grew to around <strong>250,000 clients</strong> before being acquired by a major bookmaker; after the sale the combined brands served roughly <strong>one million customers</strong>.  The same service’s premium package reported a <strong>129 % return on investment</strong> in its first year, demonstrating both the scale of the market and punters’ willingness to pay for high‑quality insights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subscribers will pay a monthly fee for unlimited access to video form guides and customised analytics, while casual punters can purchase individual races on demand.  Enterprise licensing, advertising inventory and data integrations offer additional revenue streams.  Seed capital of <strong>£750&nbsp;k</strong> will fund the AI engine, cloud infrastructure, licensing fees and management resources.  Once proven, the platform can expand into predictive analytics, training insights and other racing codes.  Exit options range from a trade sale to a bookmaker or media company to a strategic acquisition by an AI or data‑analytics firm.
