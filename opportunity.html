            <h1>The&nbsp;Opportunity</h1>
            <p>
                Horse racing enjoys a global audience and substantial turnover. Betting exchanges in the United Kingdom alone handle more than £8&nbsp;billion annually, while Hong&nbsp;Kong’s racing turnover reached HK$138.85&nbsp;billion (£13.2&nbsp;billion) in the 2024–25 season. Remote sports betting generates £2.4&nbsp;billion in gross gambling yield (GGY) in Britain, with horse racing contributing £771.1&nbsp;million. On a global scale, the horse racing market is expected to grow from US$127.34&nbsp;billion in 2025 to US$182.39&nbsp;billion in 2030, a compound annual growth rate of 7.45&nbsp;percent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite this scale, the tools available to punters and analysts are rudimentary. Traditional form guides focus on finishing positions and basic speed figures, missing the contextual cues about how a horse travelled, responded to pressure or navigated traffic. Video analysis unlocks these behavioural insights but is time‑consuming when done manually. RaceVision&nbsp;AI satisfies the latent demand for deeper analysis in a way that scales across jurisdictions.

            </ul>

        <h2>AI video analytics adoption</h2>
        <p>
            Sports such as football, cycling and athletics have already deployed computer‑vision systems to track athletes, overlay real‑time data on broadcasts and provide coaches with performance insights.  These technologies yield measurable benefits: deeper tactical understanding, improved athlete welfare and fan engagement.  Yet horse racing has lagged behind, still relying on manual timing and subjective analysis.  RaceVision&nbsp;AI brings racing in line with other sports by automating the capture of sectional times, positions and running styles across thousands of races.
        </p>
        <p>
            AI adoption in sport is accelerating because of lower processing costs and improved model accuracy.  Video analytics platforms have moved from bespoke systems into accessible cloud services, enabling small teams to build sophisticated products.  In racing, the timeliness of information is critical; punters need to act before market prices adjust.  Automating video analysis shortens the feedback loop and provides insights that were previously impossible at scale.
