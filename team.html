            <h1>Founders - Justin Ricketts and Tim Hodgson</h1
            
            <p> Ricketts and Tim Hodgson are long-time collaborators and innovators who share a belief in the power of sport to inspire change and the transformative potential of AI to scale that impact. Together, they bring over 50 years of experience at the intersection of sport, technology, and purpose, with a proven history of building commercially successful, creative, and impact-driven ventures.<p>
            
            <p> Their partnership began at Octagon in 2005 and continued through Ensemble to 2016, where they worked side by side to deliver some of the most iconic programs in Australian sport. From creating the AUD$20m per year XXXX Gold International Beach Cricket Series, to producing Rexona’s Greatest Athlete (a prime-time TV series), to architecting KFC’s transformational cricket sponsorship strategy that reshaped the category for more than a decade, Justin and Tim demonstrated how creativity, commercial strategy, and sport could be fused to capture imaginations and deliver outsized returns.<p> 
            
            <p>  Justin brings three decades of entrepreneurial leadership in sport, entertainment, and technology. He founded and sold Playsport New Media, delivering pioneering grassroots sports tech and landmark global events like the £2.3m Man vs Machine Chess Challenge, generating US$125m in media coverage. Today, as Global Chief Transformation Officer at Hogarth (WPP’s $750m creative production powerhouse), he spearheads AI-driven change across 30+ markets for the world’s biggest brands. His career reflects a consistent ability to spot emerging opportunities, harness technology, and build lasting commercial platforms.<p> 
            
            <p>  Tim’s career began on the cricket field with Essex before shifting to sports marketing and content creation. He co-founded Ensemble with Justin in 2010, a content marketing agency within IPG, and went on to bring the Invictus Games to Australia in 2018, helping to build a global movement of inclusion, resilience, and inspiration. More recently, he has focused on impact ventures: founding and selling My Net Zero, a consultancy and tech platform helping businesses engage employees in climate action, and subsequently founding Impact GPT, educating and supporting businesses to unearth AI use cases that accelerate impactful projects. Tim combines commercial creativity with a focus on impact, believing that authentic, impact-driven organisations attract great people, partners, and investors.<p> 
            
            <p> Together, Justin and Tim embody the DNA of NextPlay AI: entrepreneurial drive, global relationships, deep expertise in sport and technology, and a commitment to making a measurable difference in people’s lives. Their complementary skillsets - Justin’s in sports technology, AI transformation, and commercial partnerships, and Tim’s in commercially driven impact-led ventures, storytelling, and behaviour change - create a unique foundation for a new kind of venture studio.<p> 
            
            <p> With NextPlay AI, they are once again joining forces to unlock sport’s unmatched trust and reach, amplified by the speed and scale of artificial intelligence. Their shared vision is simple but ambitious: to build ventures that not only grow commercially but also tackle some of the world’s most pressing challenges—from education and wellbeing to climate action and community connection.<p>
