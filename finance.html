            <h1>Financials &amp; projections</h1>
            <p>
                We are seeking to raise <strong>£750&nbsp;k</strong> in seed capital to fund the development of RaceVision&nbsp;AI.  Proceeds will cover computer‑vision research, scalable cloud infrastructure, video‑rights licensing, management talent and initial market penetration.  A fully funded plan allows us to launch a revenue‑generating beta within six months and a public release within a year.  Our financing strategy assumes a pre‑money valuation of around <strong>£3&nbsp;million</strong>, implying that the seed investor would acquire about <strong>20&nbsp;%</strong> of the company for their investment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The addressable market for horse‑racing intelligence is substantial.  Major bookmakers collectively service tens of millions of customers, yet only a small fraction are serious punters.  We estimate there are roughly <strong>0.5–1 million professional or semi‑professional racing punters</strong> globally.  Under our medium scenario, reaching <strong>10,000</strong> paying subscribers by year&nbsp;3 equates to approximately <strong>1–2 %</strong> of that base.  With pricing around <strong>£200 per month</strong> and complementary enterprise licensing, pay‑per‑race and advertising revenues, our financial model projects annual income in the tens of millions by year&nbsp;3 and approaching the £60–120&nbsp;million range by year&nbsp;five.  Because our service is delivered digitally, incremental subscribers add minimal cost and drive strong margins.

            <p>
                The table below outlines a representative scenario demonstrating the long‑term revenue potential of RaceVision&nbsp;AI in year five.  It assumes <strong>20,000 professional subscribers</strong> across multiple jurisdictions and conservative uptake in enterprise licences and pay‑per‑race sales.  These figures represent annual revenue projections in year five under our medium case and are consistent with the assumptions used in the P&amp;L scenarios that follow.

            <h2>Projected P&amp;L scenarios</h2>
            <p>
                To illustrate the medium‑term return potential, the table below outlines three scenarios over a five‑year horizon.  Each case reflects different rates of subscriber adoption, enterprise licensing and advertising uptake.  Operating costs scale with usage but benefit from economies of scale as the platform matures.
            </p>
            <table class="data-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>

                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Low case</td>
                        <td>£20&nbsp;million</td>
                        <td>£4&nbsp;million</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Medium case</td>
                        <td>£60&nbsp;million</td>
                        <td>£15&nbsp;million</td>
                        <td>£120&nbsp;million</td>
                        <td>£30&nbsp;million</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>High case</td>
                        <td>£120&nbsp;million</td>
                        <td>£30&nbsp;million</td>
                        <td>£250&nbsp;million</td>
                        <td>£70&nbsp;million</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                <strong>Assumptions:</strong> The low case assumes around 10,000 professional subscribers by year&nbsp;3 and 20,000 by year&nbsp;5, paying on average £200 per month.  It also includes five enterprise partners paying roughly £250&nbsp;k each per year and modest pay‑per‑race and advertising revenue.  The medium case models 30,000 subscribers growing to 60,000, plus 20 enterprise partners, a growing pay‑per‑race user base and steady sponsorship sales.  The high case envisions 60,000 subscribers by year&nbsp;3 rising to 120,000 by year&nbsp;5, complemented by 50 partners and strong B2B licensing and advertising revenue.  Operating margins improve from roughly 25&nbsp;% in the early years to more than 40&nbsp;% as fixed costs are leveraged.  Under the medium scenario the initial investment could be repaid within three years, with substantial upside thereafter.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cost considerations:</strong> These scenarios incorporate sizeable ongoing operating costs.  Processing and storing thousands of high‑definition race videos require significant cloud compute and bandwidth, which we estimate at 20–25&nbsp;% of revenue.  Licensing and ingesting new footage account for a further 10–15&nbsp;%, while marketing, customer support and continuous analytics development add around 10&nbsp;%.  Because subscription and enterprise revenues begin immediately with the beta launch, the business is designed to be revenue generating and largely self‑funding early on, with costs scaling proportionally as uptake grows.

            <h2>Risks &amp; mitigation</h2>
            <p>
                Our business faces a number of execution and regulatory risks.  These include delays or difficulties in securing video rights, sudden changes in gambling regulation, technical challenges in maintaining model accuracy across varied track conditions, adoption resistance from punters accustomed to traditional form guides and the entry of well‑financed competitors.  We will mitigate these risks by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diversifying data partnerships:</strong> Securing licensing agreements with multiple broadcasters and jurisdictions so that our service is not reliant on a single rights holder.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining regulatory compliance:</strong> Hiring legal experts to monitor gambling and data‑privacy laws and adapting our product as regulations evolve.  We will incorporate responsible‑gaming tools and age verification where required.</li>
                <li><strong>Continual model improvement:</strong> Implementing a feedback loop with professional users to flag misidentifications or anomalies, and retraining models regularly to accommodate different camera angles, lighting conditions and racing jurisdictions.</li>
                <li><strong>User education &amp; marketing:</strong> Providing tutorials and ambassador‑led content to help punters understand and trust AI‑driven analysis, easing the transition from traditional form guides.</li>
                <li><strong>Building first‑mover advantage:</strong> Moving quickly to establish partnerships and brand recognition, making it harder for new entrants to displace us.  A scalable, cloud‑based architecture will allow us to onboard customers rapidly.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Exit strategies</h2>
            <p>
                There are multiple ways to realise value for investors once the platform achieves traction.  Potential exit scenarios include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trade sale to a bookmaker or exchange:</strong> Large wagering operators constantly seek proprietary analytics and differentiated content to attract customers.  Acquiring RaceVision&nbsp;AI would provide them with a competitive edge.</li>
                <li><strong>Acquisition by a sports‑data or media company:</strong> Rights holders and broadcasters increasingly invest in data and analysis platforms.  Our service would complement their content portfolios and open new revenue streams.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic investment from an analytics or technology firm:</strong> Companies in AI or cloud computing may acquire or invest in RaceVision&nbsp;AI to enter the racing market or showcase their technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Management buy‑out or IPO:</strong> Should the business scale rapidly and achieve strong profitability, a public listing or management buy‑out could provide liquidity while retaining independence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Proposed shareholding &amp; valuation</h2>
            <p>
                Based on the £3&nbsp;million pre‑money valuation and £750&nbsp;k seed raise outlined above, the post‑money valuation would be £3.75&nbsp;million.  The table below illustrates an updated equity allocation following the seed round, along with illustrative values in year five assuming the medium case financial scenario.  For valuation purposes we apply an 8× multiple to the projected year‑five net profit of £30&nbsp;million, yielding an enterprise value of approximately £240&nbsp;million.

                These numbers are indicative and will be finalised during negotiations.  The intent is to align incentives across founders, investors and strategic partners while preserving sufficient equity for future fundraising.  The five‑year valuation is provided to illustrate potential upside under the medium growth scenario and does not constitute a guarantee of future performance.
