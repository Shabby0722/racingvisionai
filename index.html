        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The thrill of the track lies not only in who wins but in how the race unfolds – the break from the gates, the battles for position and the surging finish.  For punters these moments are everything, yet the clues they offer are buried in hours of video and rows of numbers.  <strong>RaceVision&nbsp;AI</strong> is built for punters: by applying cutting‑edge computer vision and automated editing we transform raw race footage into dynamic, personalised form guides.  Within minutes you see where a horse settled, when it made its move and how it responded to pressure – all the information you need to punt with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our flagship product identifies horses using their racing colours and physical characteristics, tracks their positions throughout the race and compiles bespoke highlight reels that reveal tactical patterns and hidden trends.  It reduces analysis time by 90&nbsp;percent and surfaces insights that even expert reviewers miss.  The goal is simple: give punters a decisive edge in one of the largest wagering markets on earth.
