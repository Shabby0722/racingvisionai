            <h1>The&nbsp;Idea</h1>
            <p>
                NextPlay&nbsp;AI’s flagship product, <strong>RaceVision&nbsp;AI</strong>, is an AI‑powered video intelligence platform for horse racing. It automatically identifies individual horses by analysing racing silks and physical characteristics and then generates dynamic video form guides. By assembling highlight reels that showcase each horse’s recent performances, sectional timings and racing patterns, the platform gives punters and analysts a comprehensive visual record at a glance.

            <h2>Why it will work</h2>
            <p>
                Horse racing is one of the world’s most wagered‑upon sports, with more than 100,000 races each year and over US$100&nbsp;billion staked globally.  Yet punters still rely on static form guides that ignore the subtleties of how a race unfolds.  Professional punters and syndicates already spend countless hours reviewing footage because they know those nuances translate into profit.  By automating the process, we unlock insights at a speed and scale no human can match.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our computer‑vision models are trained on vast databases of racing colours and biometric markers and achieve identification accuracy above 94&nbsp;%.  The technology has been proven in other sports; we’re simply applying it to horse racing, where the need is greater and the competition is minimal.  With high‑quality footage available from broadcasters and racing authorities, we can turn idle archives into a data goldmine.  This isn’t speculation – it’s a necessary evolution for a market hungry for better information.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Huge volume of races:</strong> More than 100&nbsp;000 races each year across major jurisdictions creates a steady stream of video data and betting opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Time savings:</strong> Professional punters currently spend dozens of hours per week reviewing footage.  Our AI reduces review time by roughly 90&nbsp;%, freeing analysts to focus on strategy and staking.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Identification accuracy exceeds 94&nbsp;% when models are trained on racing silks and biometric markers, ensuring reliable analysis across races.</li>
                <li><strong>Premium value:</strong> Punters are willing to pay for an analytical edge.  Exchange markets such as those in the UK handle billions annually; even small improvements in analysis yield large financial returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Video highlights drive higher user engagement and social sharing than static text, creating organic marketing and network effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Large betting markets:</strong> More than US$100&nbsp;billion is wagered on horse racing every year, with Britain’s remote sports betting market alone generating £2.4&nbsp;billion in gross gambling yield.  A tiny slice of this spend directed towards better tools yields significant revenue.</li>

            <h2>Pain points &amp; why now</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional form guides distil a horse’s past runs into a handful of numbers – finishing positions, margins beaten and maybe a speed rating.  They rarely capture the way a horse travelled, its position in running or how it responded when asked for an effort.  Punters who want this context currently have to watch entire replays and keep notes, a labour‑intensive process that limits scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                While other sports such as football and basketball have embraced AI‑powered video analytics to identify players, track movement patterns and generate automated highlights, horse racing remains largely untouched.  Computer vision can now recognise horses via racing colours and biometrics with high accuracy, and cloud processing makes it cost‑effective to analyse hundreds of races per day.  The convergence of affordable AI tools and widespread video archives makes this the right moment to transform racing analysis.
